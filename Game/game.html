					<h3>The Crown ðŸ‘‘</h3>
					<p>This is the Imperium to which you belong. You pay taxes, and they fight your wars(mostly).
					They won't bother with any bandit or barbarian threats from within, the Army considers them 
					'too petty'. However, if you do decide to mess with them, like if you would declare independance
					from the Imperium, you can expect a quick and bloody death unless you're very prepared or allied
					with another great Imperium. </p>
					
					<p>Benifits of having a good relation with the crown includes trade access with all of the cities under
					their control, a possibly lower tax rate, and favor in protection when other Imperiums attack 
					your territory. </p>
					
					<p>Right now, the roads are terrible and you haven't got an embassy, so they will get annoyed at the slightest
					interaction. Unless it is to pay taxes. Everybody loves taxes. </p>

					<h3>The Church &#9960;</h3>
					<p>Many years ago, there was a religious civil war in the Crown regions, and during the war, an enterprising
					pope built a state within the Imperium, using the instability in order to grow his empire. The war stopped 
					before he could turn the entire Imperium into a theocracy, but there is still a Papal presence within
					the Imperium. They have vast amounts of control, being the official church of the entire continent. As such,
					they act as a mini-state, collecting tithes and participating in wars.</p>
					
					<p>If you do ally yourself with this state, they can grant you virtual immunity to invasions by declaring 
					your town a holy site, they will subsidize the construction of churches and the salaries of priests, subsidize
					papal education in your settlement, and even encourage migration into your settlement.</p>
					
					<p>However, you can't really do anything right now, as you don't have a proper embassy to receive them in.</p>

					<h3>Barbarians &#9876;</h3>
					<p>These people on the other side of the forest are savages!

					instead of as a you! Also, they eat snails! Disgusting! It is postively your duty to smite them all!</p>
					
					<p>They are very unfriendly. Any attempt to establish rapport ends with a beheading. However, if you somehow
